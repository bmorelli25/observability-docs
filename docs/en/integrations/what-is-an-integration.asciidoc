// Ingest Observability data from popular services into the Elastic Stack

An Elastic integration is a collection of assets that defines how to observe a specific product with the Elastic Stack.
These assets include:

* Data ingest, storage, and transformation rules
* Configuration options
* Pre-built, custom dashboards and visualizations
* Documentation
* Tests

Integrations have a strict, well-defined structure, and offer a number of benefits over other ingest options:

* Structured around the service that is being observed--not the monitoring agent
* Easy, less error-prone configuration
* Fewer monitoring agents for users to install
* Deploy in just a few clicks
* Decoupled release process from the Elastic Stack

== Why build an integration?

* You want to observe _some_ service
* You observe that service by ingesting metrics and/or logs from it
* You want to visualize this data in a meaningful way

== Repositories

// While this repository contains sources for Elastic Integrations, built Elastic Integrations are stored in the Package Storage repository and served up via the Package Registry. The Fleet UI in Kibana connects to the Package Registry and allows users to discover, install, and configure Elastic Packages.

=== Package specification

* Formal spec of what an Elastic package is
* What we use for validation of new or updated packages

Repo: https://github.com/elastic/package-spec

Right now it's on V1. Should we pull some of this content into the documentation?

=== Package storage

* Backing store for the package registry service
* Whatever you see in this repo is what you can find via the package registry service
* 3 branches: snapshot, staging, production
