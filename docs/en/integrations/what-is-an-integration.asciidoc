// Ingest Observability data from popular services into the Elastic Stack

An Elastic integration is a collection of assets that defines how to observe a specific product with the Elastic Stack.
Integrations offer a number of benefits over other Observability options:

* Structured around the service that is being observed--not the monitoring agent
* Easy, less error-prone configuration
* Fewer monitoring agents for users to install
* Deploy in just a few clicks
* Decoupled release process from the Elastic Stack

The assets contained in an integration can define every step of the observability process:

* Data transformation, ingestion, and storage.
* Data visualization
* Elastic Agent configuration
* Documentation
* Tests

Integrations have a strict, well-defined structure.
This structure is described by the package specification.

== Why build an integration?

* You want to observe _some_ service
* You observe that service by ingesting metrics and/or logs from it
* You want to visualize this data in a meaningful way
